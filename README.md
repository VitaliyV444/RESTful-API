REST API with Express.js and MongoDB
This is a simple RESTful API built with Express.js and MongoDB, designed to handle CRUD operations for managing posts. Users can create, read, update, and delete posts through HTTP requests.

Technologies Used
Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build the API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage post data. MongoDB provides flexibility and scalability for handling data in a JSON-like format.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to simplify interactions with the MongoDB database.
Express-fileupload: Middleware for Express.js used to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload images along with their posts.
Features
Create Post: Users can create a new post by sending a POST request with post data and an optional image.
Read Post: Users can retrieve all posts or a specific post by sending GET requests to the appropriate endpoints.
Update Post: Users can update an existing post by sending a PUT request with the updated post data.
Delete Post: Users can delete a post by sending a DELETE request with the post ID.
