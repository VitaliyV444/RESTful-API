# REST API with Express.js and MongoDB

This is a simple RESTful API built with Express.js and MongoDB, designed to handle CRUD operations for managing posts. Users can create, read, update, and delete posts through HTTP requests.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js used to build the API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store and manage post data. MongoDB provides flexibility and scalability for handling data in a JSON-like format.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to simplify interactions with the MongoDB database.
- **Express-fileupload**: Middleware for Express.js used to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload images along with their posts.

## Features

- **Create Post**: Users can create a new post by sending a POST request with post data and an optional image.
- **Read Post**: Users can retrieve all posts or a specific post by sending GET requests to the appropriate endpoints.
- **Update Post**: Users can update an existing post by sending a PUT request with the updated post data.
- **Delete Post**: Users can delete a post by sending a DELETE request with the post ID.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rest-api-express-mongodb.git
   
2. Install dependencies:
   cd rest-api-express-mongodb
   npm install
   
3. Configure MongoDB:
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account or set up a local MongoDB server.
   - Update the `DB_URL` variable in `index.js` with your MongoDB connection string.

4. Start the server:
   npm start
   npm run dev (with nodemon usage)

## Usage

- Ensure the server is running.
- Use an HTTP client like Postman or cURL to send requests to the API endpoints.
- Refer to the API documentation or source code for available endpoints and request formats.
